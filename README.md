SUV PURCHASE PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Made by: Gabriele Sollai and Stefano Apicella

The aim of this project is to use a logistic regression in order to predict the probability that random people will buy or not an SUV using their age, gender and salary.
To train our model we used a dataset found on Kaggle.com, a wonderful website where the community shares datasets and goals associated with them.
The reader can find this dataset at this link:

FOLDER CONTENT

-An .Rmd file. This is our script, written in Rmarkdown with some lines of CSS code in  order to better format our slides;
-The used dataset, uploaded in .csv format
-An .html file which is our final result coming from the Rmarkdown file

SUGGESTION FOR A BETTER USE

If the reader wants to run our .Rmd script in RStudio, the only thing that he/she has to do is to change the working directory with the setwd() command, substituting the one in our script. The reader has just to copy and paste, between (""), changing "\" with "/", his/her PC's path to this folder.
To better read the final .html output we suggest to open it with Google Chrome. Once it's open click on 'f' button to see it in full screen mode and then click on ctrl and + (if using Windows) or Command and + (if using MacOS) to zoom and read it in a better way. 
Slides are scrollable so you can go up and down in each of them in order to read all of our results.
Thanks for your attention.
